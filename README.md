# TicTacToeGame
This project is a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) application which replicates the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. This personal project was created using core Java elements such as java.swing* and java.awt* in order to learn about the basics of building GUI applications on Java. This game serves as an introduction to the world of GUI and allowed me to learn the various packages, classes and methods implemented when building a simple GUI program. It also allowed me to experiment with the usage of JPanel, JButtons and other component classes. Overall, the game served as an introduction to GUI, allowed me to explore my interests and deepen my understanding of Java and it's real-world applications.

# Functionalities

# 1. Random Generation of Players' Turns
The game has been designed to ensure that it is fair, thus the game ensures that there is a random generation of each players turn whenever the game is played. 

# 2. Identification of Winner
The game has been designed with a method called check(), which is constantly checking to see whether any of the players have one. As a result, as soon as one of the winning conditions have been triggered, the game will display a message to the user, allowing them to understand that the game has now terminated. The winning conditions include consecutive Xs/Os in a row, column, or from corner to corner of the grid.
